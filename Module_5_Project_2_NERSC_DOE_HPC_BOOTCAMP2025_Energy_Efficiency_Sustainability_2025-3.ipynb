    "\n",
    "High-Performance Computing (HPC) is the engine of discovery ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also an energy-hungry beast.  \n",
    "Every simulation, training run, or data processing job you launch draws from a complex ecosystem of power infrastructure, cooling systems, and the electrical grid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025, a **top-tier supercomputer can consume as much electricity as a small town**. That energy footprint is tied not just to **cost**, but also to **carbon emissions**, **grid stability**, and **community impact**.  \n",
    "With DOE‚Äôs push toward **energy justice**, **sustainability**, and **science per kilowatt-hour**, the next generation of HPC professionals must think beyond FLOPS ‚Äî and design systems that deliver maximum scientific impact with minimal environmental cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **data-driven thinking** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you‚Äôll be handed a realistic set of **facility parameters, job classes, and energy metrics**. Your mission is to reason through trade-offs:\n",
    "- **When** should jobs run to minimize both **dollars** and **CO‚ÇÇ**?\n",
    "- How do **cooling choices** and **PUE** shift the sustainability profile?\n",
    "- Which workloads give you the most **science per unit of energy**?\n",
    "- If the grid is dirty at noon but clean at midnight, can your scheduler take advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the kind of decision-making HPC center directors, facility managers, and DOE program leads face every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions provided here give you a starting point ‚Äî but you‚Äôre encouraged to tweak them to explore **what-if scenarios**.  \n",
    "In the real world, a small shift in **PUE**, **energy price**, or **job mix** can mean millions of dollars saved and thousands of tons of CO‚ÇÇ avoided.\n",

    "In this section, we will delve into the social justice implications of the energy consumption of HPC systems and potential strategies for improving their energy sustainability. The importance of this topic lies in the fact that the energy consumption of these systems can contribute to energy inequality, particularly in regions where resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the social justice implications of the energy consumption of these systems, we can identify ways to promote energy justice and reduce the environmental impact of these systems. This is crucial in promoting a more sustainable use of computing resources and aligning with the principles of energy justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, by exploring potential strategies for improving the energy sustainability of these systems, we can contribute to the development of more sustainable HPC systems. Therefore, understanding these strategies is essential for anyone working with HPC systems.\n",
